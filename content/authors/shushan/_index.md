I’m a final year PhD candidate at the University of Southern California. I am part of Intelligence and Knowledge Discovery Lab ( [INK lab](https://inklab.usc.edu/) ), supervised by Prof. Xiang Ren. In the past, I was an intern at Microsoft Research, and Google.

I am currently on the job market, looking for Research Scientist positions. My research interests and experience lie in large language models and their generalization, particularly, in applications for software and code.
